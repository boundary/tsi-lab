ReST was defined\nby Roy Thomas Fielding in his 2000 PhD dissertation \nArchitectural Styles and the Design\nof Network-based Software Architectures\n ReST is just a fancy name for protocol you use\neveryday in a web browser called HTTP\n\n(\nH\nyper\nt\next \nT\nransfer \nP\nrotocol)\n.\n\n\nThis section provides the essential background to understand how to use the HTTP protocol with\npractical exercises using \ncurl\n command line utility.\n\n\nThe last part of this lab provides a quick overview of the ReST API provided to manipulate:\n\n\n\n\nMetrics\n\n\nMeasures\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\n\nThe HTTP Protocol\n\n\nA logical starting to talk about the HTTP protocol is to talk about the HTTP request methods.\nOne of the most prevalent of these HTTP methods is \nGET\n which is readily used by a browser\n\n\nURI\n\n\nA \nURI\n or \nU\nniform \nResource\n \nL\nocator is a string of characters used to identify a resource.\nThe most prevalent form of a URI is a \nURL\n or \nU\nniform \nResource\n \nL\nocator usually called a\n\nweb address\n. A notated example of URL is shown here:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprotocol - For the purpose of this lab either: \nHTTP\n or \nHTTPS\n, though there are others\nsuch as \nFTP\n.\n\n\ndomain name - Fully qualified domain name or IP address.\n\n\nresource (or path) - Forward slash delimited string uniquely identifying a resource.\n\n\nparameter - URL parameter with specific details of a resource.\n\n\n\n\nHeaders\n\n\nHeaders accompany both \nHTTP requests\n and \nHTTP responses\n.\n\n\nHTTP Request Header\n\n\nThe following are the typical request headers to be encountered for this lab\n\n\nAuthentication\n\n\nThis header contains specific authentication data used by the server determine if you\nhave sufficient privilege to execute the request. Typical types of authentication headers\ninclude: \nBasic\n, \nDigest\n, \nChallenge-Response\n. For this lab we will only be using Basic.\n\n\nAccept\n\n\nCommunicates the clients acceptable contain that it can receive in a response.\n\n\nContent-Type\n\n\nIndicates to the server the content type included in the clients request, typical values include:\n\n\n\n\napplication/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\n\napplication/json\n\n\napplication/xml\n\n\n\n\nHTTP Response\n\n\nThe following are the typical response headers to be encountered for this lab.\n\n\nContent-Type\n\n\nWhat is contained ion the body of the HTTP response (\ntext/html\n, \napplication/json\n).\n\n\nContent-Length\n\n\nSize of the HTTP response body returned to the client.\n\n\nStatus Codes\n\n\nWhen HTTP request method (\nGET\n, \nPOST\n, \nPUT\n, \nDELETE\n) is issued to a endpoint the HTTP protocol accounts\nfor returning a status code indicating the result of the request. The Status codes themselves\nare classified by the range of their values:\n\n\n\n\n2XX - Success - The request was received and processed successfully.\n\n\n3XX - Redirection - The client must must take additional action to complete the request.\n\n\n4XX - Client Error - The clients request has an error of some type and could not be completed.\n\n\n5XX - Server Error - The server failed to fulfil a request\n\n\n\n\nFor the sake of this lab, and the APIs to be introduced later, the table shows the relevant HTTP status\ncodes we need to be aware of:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatus Code\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n200 OK\n\n\nStandard response for successfull requests .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n201 CREATED\n\n\nPort of the Kafka JMX endpoint.

Specifically in the\nremainder of the lab you will use the following APIs:\n\n\n\n\nMetric\n\n\nMeasurement\n\n\nEvent\n\n\n\n\nMetrics versus Measures\n\n\nMetrics\n are the \nthing\n to be measured like CPU or network traffic. A \nmeasurement\n is a specific time\nseries point of a specific metric. For example, the \nCPU\n metric defines the collection of the CPU\nutilization on a host, and measurement is the specific value (e.g 60%) at a given point in time.\n\n\nMetrics\n\n\nA metric is uniquely identified by its name. A metric definition consists of the following fields:\n\n\n\n\nName - Primary key of the metric\n\n\nDisplay Name - Label used in the Web Interface to represent the metric.\n\n\nDisplay Name Short - Label is used when representing a metric when space in the Web\nInterface is minimal\n\n\nDefault Aggregate - Defines the aggregate to be displayed in a graph by default. One of: \navg\n,\n\nmin\n, \nmax\n, \nsum\n.\n\n\nDefault Resolution - Indicator(in milliseconds) of how often measurements can be expected for this metric.\n\n\nUnit - Unit of measurement for the metric, which is one of: \nbytecount\n, \nduration\n,\n\nnumber\n, \npercent\n.\n\n\nType - Used to classify or group like metrics. Typically a device metric, a plugin metric, but\ncan be of any arbitrary string value.\n\n\n\n\nMetric APIs\n\n\n\n\nCreate\n\n\nGet\n\n\nUpdate\n\n\nDelete\n\n\n\n\nMeasurements\n\n\nMeasurements represent the the actual time series data point. A measurement consists of 4 pieces of information:\n\n\n\n\nmetric\n\n\nvalue\n\n\nsource\n\n\ntimestamp\n\n\n\n\nMeasurement APIs\n\n\n\n\nCreate\n\n\nGet\n\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\nEvent API\n\n\n\n\nCreate\n\n\nGet\n\n\nList Events\n\n\nList Raw Events",
