TrueSight Intelligence Lab
==========================

Vagrant lab environment for learning about TrueSight Pulse Intelligence.

Includes:

- Virtual machine environment that includes prerequisite tools for running labs.
- Demonstration scripts for running labs.
- All software dependencies for running demonstration scripts.

__It is imperative that you install the prerequisites on your laptop/desktop BEFORE attempting to
complete these labs! See [Prerequisites](getting_started/prerequisites.md) for details.__

## Virtual Machine

To avoid having to worry about the numerous dependency differences between Windows, Mac OS X, Unix/Linux,
we are providing a virtual machine that contains the necessary software tools to complete the lab
exercises.

The virtual machine environment is configured using vagrant, so it requires the prerequisites
listed [here](gettting_started/prerequisites.md) for your particular laptop/desktop and operating system.
