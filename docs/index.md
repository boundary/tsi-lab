TrueSight Intelligence Lab
==========================
__version 0.8.11__

Welcome to the TrueSight Intelligence API Learning Lab. This is a self-paced guide with hands on examples of using
APIs to send time series data and events to TrueSight Intelligence. This guide starts out with simple
practical examples showing how to use each of the APIs. After understanding the basics of using the APIs,
the labs progress to more real world examples that show you how to extract time series data and
events from system domains typically encountered.

To aide in the learning process a virtual machine with all the needed prerequisites and sources of data
are included. This creates a reusable self-contained environment rather than having to worry about setting up
all the dependencies on ones own laptop/desktop wth the numerous dependency differences between
Windows, Mac OS X, Unix/Linux.

__It is imperative that you install the prerequisites on your laptop/desktop BEFORE attempting to
complete these labs! See [Prerequisites](getting_started/prerequisites.md) for details.__
