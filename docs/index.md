TrueSight Intelligence Lab
==========================
__version 0.1.1__

Virtual machine lab environment for learning about TrueSight Pulse Intelligence.

Rather than having to worry about the numerous dependency differences between
Windows, Mac OS X, Unix/Linux, we have developed this virtual machine that contains
all the necessary software tools to complete the lab exercises.

__It is imperative that you install the prerequisites on your laptop/desktop BEFORE attempting to
complete these labs! See [Prerequisites](getting_started/prerequisites.md) for details.__
