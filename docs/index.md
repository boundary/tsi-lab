TrueSight Intelligence Lab
==========================
__version 0.8.10__

all the necessary software tools to complete the lab exercises.

__It is imperative that you install the prerequisites on your laptop/desktop BEFORE attempting to
complete these labs! See [Prerequisites](getting_started/prerequisites.md) for details.__
