Lab 2 - Introduction ReST
=========================

## Overview

This lab introduces ReST or *R*epresentational *S*tate *T*ransfer. ReST was defined
by Roy Thomas Fielding in his 2000 PhD dissertation _Architectural Styles and the Design
of Network-based Software Architectures_ ReST is just a fancy name for protocol you use
everyday in a web browser called HTTP
[(*H*yper*t*ext *T*ransfer *P*rotocol)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol).

This section provides the essential background to understand how to use the HTTP protocol with
practical exercises using [curl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL) command line utility.

The last part of this lab provides a quick overview of the ReST API provided to manipulate:

- Metrics
- Measures
- Events

## The HTTP Protocol

A logical starting to talk about the HTTP protocol is to talk about the HTTP request methods.
One of the most prevalent of these HTTP methods is `GET` which is readily used by a browser


### URI

A _URI_ or *U*niform *Resource* *L*ocator is a string of characters used to identify a resource.
The most prevalent form of a URI is a _URL_ or *U*niform *Resource* *L*ocator usually called a
_web address_. A notated example of URL is shown here:

- protocol - For the purpose of this lab either: _HTTP_ or _HTTPS_, though there are others
such as _FTP_.
- domain name - Fully qualified domain name or IP address.
- resource (or path) - Forward slash delimited string uniquely identifying a resource.
- parameter - URL parameter with specific details of a resource.

### Headers

Headers accompany both _HTTP requests_ and _HTTP responses_.

#### HTTP Request Header

The following are the typical request headers to be encountered for this lab

##### Authentication

This header contains specific authentication data used by the server determine if you
have sufficient privilege to execute the request. Typical types of authentication headers
include: _Basic_, _Digest_, _Challenge-Response_. For this lab we will only be using Basic.

##### Accept

Communicates the clients acceptable contain that it can receive in a response.

##### Content-Type
Indicates to the server the content type included in the clients request, typical values include:

- `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
- `application/json`
- `application/xml`

#### HTTP Response

The following are the typical response headers to be encountered for this lab.

##### Content-Type

What is contained ion the body of the HTTP response (`text/html`, `application/json`).

##### Content-Length

Size of the HTTP response body returned to the client.

### Status Codes

When HTTP request method (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) is issued to a endpoint the HTTP protocol accounts
for returning a status code indicating the result of the request. The Status codes themselves
are classified by the range of their values:

- 2XX - Success - The request was received and processed successfully.
- 3XX - Redirection - The client must must take additional action to complete the request.
- 4XX - Client Error - The clients request has an error of some type and could not be completed.
- 5XX - Server Error - The server failed to fulfil a request

For the sake of this lab, and the APIs to be introduced later, the table shows the relevant HTTP status
codes we need to be aware of:

|Status Code                | Description                                                                                              |
|:--------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 200 OK                    | Standard response for successfull requests .                             |
| 201 CREATED               | Port of the Kafka JMX endpoint. Defaults to 9990.                        |
| 202 ACCEPTED              | Username of the Kafka JMX endpoint.                                      |
| 400 BAD REQUEST           | The server is unable to process the client request that is in error.     |
| 401 UNAUTHORIZED          | Authentication is required but was not provided by the client.           |
| 404 NOT FOUND             | The request resource could not be found.                                 |
| 422 UNPROCESSABLE ENTITY  | The request was well-formed but contains a semantic error.               |
| 500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR | A generic error, when unexpected condition was encountered.              |
| 503 SERVICE UNAVAILABLE   | The server is currently unavailable (overloaded or down for maintenance).|
| 504 GATEWAY TIMEOUT       | The server did not receive a timely response from the upstream server.   |

### JSON

JSON or [Java Script Object Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) while not specifically
part of HTTP is a prerequisite for the TrueSight Pulse APIs to be introduced later.

JSON (Not to be confused with [Jason Voorhees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Voorhees)
of the [Friday the 13th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday_the_13th_(franchise)) series) is a:

- Open Standard Format
- Human Readable

The best way to learn JSON is to observe a JSON as shown here:

```
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "isAlive": true,
  "age": 25,
  "address": {
    "streetAddress": "21 2nd Street",
    "city": "New York",
    "state": "NY",
    "postalCode": "10021-3100"
  },
  "phoneNumbers": [
    {
      "type": "home",
      "number": "212 555-1234"
    },
    {
      "type": "office",
      "number": "646 555-4567"
    },
    {
      "type": "mobile",
      "number": "123 456-7890"
    }
  ],
  "children": [],
  "spouse": null
}
```

Fields are delineated by double quotes(_"_) and can have data types of numbers, strings, and booleans.
Additional array of these same data types can be formed. Object structures are created by enclosing
command separate fields between braces (_{_ and _}_).

## Using `curl` to make REST calls.

The `curl` command line utility permits the issuing http(s) request from the command line.
The following are examples of its use, which later be used to call the actual APIs.


## Exercise 2-1 `GET` request

Run the following by cutting or pasting the curl command or run the script: `labs/lab-2/ex2-1.rest.sh`

```
[vagrant@tsi-lab-01 ~]$ curl -X GET -s https://httpbin.org/get
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
```

You should see output similar to this:

```
>>>>>>> boundary/master
{
  "args": {},
  "headers": {
    "Accept": "*/*",
    "Host": "httpbin.org",
    "User-Agent": "curl/7.29.0"
  },
  "origin": "198.147.195.5",
  "url": "https://httpbin.org/get"
}
```

## Exercise 2-2 GET request with parameters

Run the following cutting or pasting the curl command or run the script: `labs/lab-2/ex2-2.rest.sh`

```
[vagrant@tsi-lab-01 ~]$ curl -X GET -s 'https://httpbin.org/get?foo=bar&color=red'
```

You should see output similar to this:
```
{
  "args": {
    "color": "red",
    "foo": "bar"
  },
  "headers": {
    "Accept": "*/*",
    "Host": "httpbin.org",
    "User-Agent": "curl/7.29.0"
  },
  "origin": "198.147.195.5",
  "url": "https://httpbin.org/get?foo=bar&color=red"
}
```

In the example above, the parameters are returned in the JSON in the field _args_.

### Exercise 2-3 `POST` request

Run the following by cutting or pasting the curl command or run the script: `labs/lab-2/ex2-3.rest.sh`

```
[vagrant@tsi-lab-01 ~]$ curl -X POST -s https://httpbin.org/post
```

You should see output similar to this:

```
{
  "args": {},
  "data": "",
  "files": {},
  "form": {},
  "headers": {
    "Accept": "*/*",
    "Host": "httpbin.org",
    "User-Agent": "curl/7.29.0"
  },
  "json": null,
  "origin": "198.147.195.5",
  "url": "https://httpbin.org/post"
}
```


### Exercise 2-4 `POST` request with a `JSON` payload

```
[vagrant@tsi-lab-01 ~]$ curl -X POST -s https://httpbin.org/post \
> -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
> -d '{"foo": "bar", "red": true, "curly": 101}'
```

You should see output similar to this:
```
{
  "args": {},
  "data": "{\"foo\": \"bar\", \"red\": true, \"curly\": 101}",
  "files": {},
  "form": {},
  "headers": {
    "Accept": "*/*",
    "Content-Length": "41",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Host": "httpbin.org",
    "User-Agent": "curl/7.29.0"
  },
  "json": {
    "curly": 101,
    "foo": "bar",
    "red": true
  },
  "origin": "198.147.195.5",
  "url": "https://httpbin.org/post"
}
```

In the example above the JSON payload sent in the request is returned in JSON document
as the field _data_.

### Exercise 2-5 `PUT` request

```
[vagrant@tsi-lab-01 ~]$ curl -X PUT -s https://httpbin.org/put \
> -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
> -d '{"foo": "bar", "red": true, "curly": 101}'
```

You should see output similar to this:

```
{
  "args": {},
  "data": "{\"foo\": \"bar\", \"red\": true, \"curly\": 101}",
  "files": {},
  "form": {},
  "headers": {
    "Accept": "*/*",
    "Content-Length": "41",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Host": "httpbin.org",
    "User-Agent": "curl/7.29.0"
  },
  "json": {
    "curly": 101,
    "foo": "bar",
    "red": true
  },
  "origin": "198.147.195.5",
  "url": "https://httpbin.org/put"
}
```

In the example above the JSON sent in the `PUT` request is returned in the field _data_.

### Exercise 2-6 `DELETE` request

```
[vagrant@tsi-lab-01 ~]$ curl -X DELETE -s https://httpbin.org/delete
```

You should see output similar to this:

```
{
  "args": {},
  "data": "",
  "files": {},
  "form": {},
  "headers": {
    "Accept": "*/*",
    "Host": "httpbin.org",
    "User-Agent": "curl/7.29.0"
  },
  "json": null,
  "origin": "198.147.195.5",
  "url": "https://httpbin.org/delete"
}
```

### Exercise 2-7 `GET` request with authentication

```
[vagrant@tsi-lab-01 ~]$ curl -X GET -s -u foo:bar 'https://httpbin.org/basic-auth/foo/bar'
```

You should see output similar to this:

```
{
  "authenticated": true,
  "user": "foo"
}
```

### Exercise 2-8 `GET` request that returns a `400`

Status codes are displayed by adding the `-i` argument to curl

```
[vagrant@tsi-lab-01 ~]$ curl -i -X GET -s https://httpbin.org/status/400
```

You should see output similar to this:

```
HTTP/1.1 400 BAD REQUEST
Server: nginx
Date: Tue, 12 Apr 2016 20:19:28 GMT
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 0

Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
```

### Exercise 2-9 `GET` request that returns a `401`

```
[vagrant@tsi-lab-01 ~]$ curl -X GET -i -u foo:blue 'https://httpbin.org/basic-auth/foo/bar'
```

You should see output similar to this:
```

```
You should see output similar to this:

```
HTTP/1.1 422 UNPROCESSABLE ENTITY
Server: nginx

Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
```

## TrueSight Pulse APIs

This section gives a brief introduction to the APIs to be used in the later labs. Specifically in the
remainder of the lab you will use the following APIs:

- Metric
- Measurement
- Event

### Metrics versus Measures

_Metrics_ are the _thing_ to be measured like CPU or network traffic. A _measurement_ is a specific time
series point of a specific metric. For example, the _CPU_ metric defines the collection of the CPU
utilization on a host, and measurement is the specific value (e.g 60%) at a given point in time.

### Metrics

A metric is uniquely identified by its name. A metric definition consists of the following fields:

- Name - Primary key of the metric
- Display Name - Label used in the Web Interface to represent the metric.
- Display Name Short - Label is used when representing a metric when space in the Web
Interface is minimal
- Default Aggregate - Defines the aggregate to be displayed in a graph by default. One of: _avg_,
_min_, _max_, _sum_.
- Default Resolution - Indicator(in milliseconds) of how often measurements can be expected for this metric.
- Unit - Unit of measurement for the metric, which is one of: _bytecount_, _duration_,
_number_, _percent_.
- Type - Used to classify or group like metrics. Typically a device metric, a plugin metric, but
can be of any arbitrary string value.

##### Metric APIs
- Create
- Get
- Update
- Delete

### Measurements

Measurements represent the the actual time series data point. A measurement consists of 4 pieces of information:

- metric
- value
- source
- timestamp

##### Measurement APIs

- Create
- Get

### Events

#### Event API

- Create
- Get
- List Events
- List Raw Events
