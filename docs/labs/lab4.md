Lab 4 - Metric and Measurement APIs
===================================

## Overview

This lab will introduce you to the Metric and Measurement APIs by showing you how to
extracting example business data from a MySQL database and sending the business data
to TrueSight Intelligence.

### Metrics versus Measurements

_Metrics_ and _Measurements_ are often used interchangeable by in the context of the TrueSight Intelligence APIs
we need to make a distinction as follows:

- *Metrics* are the *definition* of what the time series represents
- *Measurements* are the *actual* time series values that are collected

#### Metric

A metric definitions consists of the following:

- Name
- Display Name
- Display Name Short
- Description
- Default Aggregate
- Default Resolution
- Type
- Units

#### Name

This is the primary key and is used to uniquely identify each metric in an account. The name is all
uppercase with addition of underscores(`_`) and periods('.'). Some of the built-in metrics include:
CPU, Network In, or Data Disk Out.

#### Display Name

Label to identify the metric in the user interface or other place where user readable text is needed.

#### Display Name Short

Same use as _Display Name_ but in those cases where shortened text is required (limit to 20 characters).

#### Description

Provides textual information or other information relevant in describing the metric.

#### Default Aggregate

When graphing the metric that makes the most sense, which is one of:

- Average
- Minimum
- Maximum
- Sum

#### Type

TrueSight Intelligence entity type

#### Unit

This field consists of an enumerated type the describes the unit of meaurement of the metric. The types
consist of the following;

- ByteCount
- Duration
- Number
- Percent

_NOTE_: _Duration_ is milliseconds and is not current configurable. Percent is given in decimal form, for
example %63.2 would be given as 0.632.

#### Measurements

Are the time series data collected for a particular _metric_ which are made of the following:

- Metric
- Value
- Source
- Timestamp

#### Metric

Refers to the specific _Metric_ of the Measurement

#### Value

Value of the metric at the given timestamp. If the Metric unit is _percent_ then this is value in its
decimal equivalent.

#### Source

Most often the system hostname but it is used to indicate the specific instance of the thing being measured. For
example if were measuring individual utilization for CPU cores the source would refer to the specific core.

#### Timestamp

When the measurement occurred in [UNIX epoch time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) which is either
in seconds or milliseconds.

#### Properties

In addition to the previously discussed Measurement fields, there are optional fields for further
classification of a measurement.

The _Application Id_ is used to organize data in TrueSight Intelligence.

Online documentation of the Metric and Measurement APIs is located
[here](https://documentation.truesight.bmc.com/overview)

### Metric API

This section goes into the nuts and bolts of defining metrics several ways
using the Metric API.


#### Creating a Metric definition with `curl`

Metric definitions can be created with the _curl_ as shown here.

```
curl https://$TSP_API_HOST/v1/metrics \
  -X POST                             \
  -u "$TSP_EMAIL:$TSP_API_TOKEN"      \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
         "name": "MY_COOL_METRIC",
         "description": "A cool metric I created",
         "displayName": "My cool metric",
         "displayNameShort": "cool metric",
         "unit": "number",
         "defaultAggregate": "avg",
         "defaultResolutionMS": 1000,
         "type": "DEVICE"
      }'
```

#### Creating a Metric definition with `metric-create`

The command line version of metric create can be used to create a metric definition running the following:

```
$ metric-create -n CLI_METRIC -d "CLI metric"  -s "CLI metric" -g avg -u number -y DEVICE
```

which results in the following output:

```
{
  "result": {
    "name": "CLI_METRIC",
    "displayName": "CLI metric",
    "displayNameShort": "CLI metric",
    "unit": "number",
    "defaultAggregate": "AVG",
    "type": "DEVICE",
    "id": 1444
  }
}
```

_NOTE_: metric-create as are all of the CLIs use the environment variables `TSP_EMAIL` and `TSP_API_TOKEN`
for credentials and do not have to passed on the command line.

#### Creating a Metric definition with Python Metric API

The following is example of defining a metric using the Python Metric API:

```
import tspapi

api = tspapi.API()

metric = api.metric_create(name='API_METRIC',
                           display_name='API Metric',
                           display_name_short='API Metric',
                           description='An API metric',
                           default_aggregate='avg',
                           default_resolution=1000,
                           unit='number',
                           _type='STOCK_PRICE')

print(metric)

```
running the script above outputs the following:
```

Metric(name='API_METRIC', display_name='API Metric', display_name_short='API Metric', description='An API metric', default_aggregate='AVG', default_resolution=1000, unit='number', _type='STOCK_PRICE', is_disabled='False')
```



### Measurement API

The heart of this course is the ability to use the Measurement API to get data into TrueSight
Intelligence.

#### Creating a Measurement with `curl`

```
curl https://$TSP_API_HOST/v1/measurements \
  -X POST                                  \
  -u "$TSP_EMAIL:$TSP_API_TOKEN"           \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"      \
  -d '{
        "metric": "CPU",
        "source": "myserver",
        "measure": 2,
        "timestamp": 1377043134,
        "metadata": {
          "app_id": "Servers"
         }
      }'
```

#### Creating a Metric definition with `measurement-create`

You can generate a measurement using as CLI as shown here:

```
measurement-create -n CPU -m 0.8 -s 'myserver' -p app_id="LittleDog" -d 1461092253
```

which results in the following output if the measurement is successfully created:

```
{
    "result": {
        "success": true
    }
}
```

#### Creating a Measurements with the Python Measurement API

The following is example of defining a measurement using the Python Measurement API:
```
import tspapi

api = tspapi.API()

api.measurement_create(metric='CPU',
                       value=0.8,
                       source='my-server')
```

## Lab Exercise Background

This section describes a scenario in which business data is stored in a relation database
and we need to extract and send to TrueSight Intelligence. For this lab we are using the
[MariaDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MariaDB) for our relation database which is a drop in replacement
for [MySQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL). When the virtual machine was created a `cron` jobs
was created that starts populating the database with simulated data.

### The Data

The data we are interested in is located in a table named `ol_transactions` the `app` database
running in your virtual machine.

```
MariaDB [app]> describe ol_transactions;
+----------+------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| Field    | Type       | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
+----------+------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| id       | bigint(20) | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |
| dt       | datetime   | NO   |     | NULL    |                |
| total    | bigint(20) | NO   |     | NULL    |                |
| duration | double     | NO   |     | NULL    |                |
+----------+------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
```

### Viewing The Data

At the command line run the following:

```
$ mysqldb
```

This will display the following prompt:

```
[vagrant@tsi-lab-01 ~]$ mysqldb
Reading table information for completion of table and column names
You can turn off this feature to get a quicker startup with -A

MariaDB [app]>

```

Run the following SQL query which limits the return rows to 10:

```
MariaDB [app]> select * from ol_transactions limit 10;
```

Which will display output similar to below:

```
+----+---------------------+-------+----------+
| id | dt                  | total | duration |
+----+---------------------+-------+----------+
|  1 | 2016-04-18 17:26:00 |   726 |   407.31 |
|  2 | 2016-04-18 17:27:00 |   769 |   330.11 |
|  3 | 2016-04-18 17:28:00 |   529 |   460.87 |
|  4 | 2016-04-18 17:29:00 |   259 |   170.36 |
|  5 | 2016-04-18 17:30:00 |   703 |   277.52 |
|  6 | 2016-04-18 17:31:00 |   816 |   726.88 |
|  7 | 2016-04-18 17:32:00 |   465 |   150.15 |
|  8 | 2016-04-18 17:33:00 |    84 |   166.53 |
|  9 | 2016-04-18 17:34:00 |   624 |    228.7 |
| 10 | 2016-04-18 17:35:00 |   577 |   720.33 |
+----+---------------------+-------+----------+
10 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

### ETL

ETL or _Extract Transform Load_ is the term for getting data out of one system and putting to another
with the final "target database" is TrueSight Intelligence.

Data in the database table continues to grow to due the `cron` running. Since new data is adding we
have to continue query the database to get new data to send TrueSight Intelligence.

Fortunately our data has a date field that we can use to limit the queries to only the data we
have not sent to TrueSight Intelligence. This is commonly referred to as _Data Change Capture_
A bit more discussion on this to follow.

For this lab we are using the Python packages [`petl`](http://petl.readthedocs.org) and
[`pymsql`](https://github.com/PyMySQL/PyMySQL/) to query and extract data from the database.


### Data Change Capture

For this lab our data that we are going to extract has a date field so we can use this to
our advantage to extract only the data that is new. This oftern referred to as _Change Data Capture_
Even more in our favor is that older data _always_ shows up _before_ new data. It is a bit
more complicated to handle such _late arriving data_ which we will not address in this lab since
it is not needed to properly extract our data.

The first time we query the database we want to get all of the data in the past loaded and
successive queries will pull the new data.

Any time we run the query to extract data, we first determine the maximum time value
that currently exists in the database using the following SQL query:

```sql
select max(dt) as max_dt from ol_transactions
```

We then can use this date as the upper bounds of the predicate of our query.

As we said earlier the first time we extract data we want to get all of the past data and to
get the starting point in time we run the following query the first time:

```sql
select min(dt) as min_dt from ol_transactions
```
on successive queries to determine the starting point in time we have to take into account
the previous upper limit or extraction time like the following:

```sql
select min(dt) as min_dt from ol_transactions where dt >= "<date of last extraction>"
```

Because our ETL script is not running continuously we need to persist this last extraction time.
The extraction time can be written to the database if you have write access or in this lab
to the file system. On later execution of the script we read the file to get the last date
of extraction.

With the lower and upper time limits we can now extract the data with the following SQL:

```
select dt, total, duration from ol_transactions where dt > "<lower time>" and dt <=  "<upper time>"
```

### Database Access Parameters

For these labs the credentials and other database access parameters are available as environment
variables shown here, located at `~/.db`:

``` bash
export DB_HOST=localhost
export DB_USER=admin
export DB_PASSWORD=admin123
export DB_DATABASE=app
```

### Using `petl` and `pymsql`

Here is an example of how `petl` and `pymsql` are used in tandom to query for data:

```
import pymysql
import os
import petl
import pymysql

# Fetch our database access configuration from environment variables
host = os.environ['DB_HOST']
user = os.environ['DB_USER']
password = os.environ['DB_PASSWORD']
db = os.environ['DB_DATABASE']

# Connect to the database using the PyMSQL package
connection = pymysql.connect(host=host,
                             user=user,
                             password=password,
                             db=db)

# Extract the data using both PyMSQL and PETL
table = petl.fromdb(connection, 'SELECT dt, total, duration FROM ol_transactions')
print(table)

connection.close()
```

### Metrics

Before proceeding on extracting data we need to define the metrics that we will be collecting. In our
case will be collecting the _total transactions_ and _transaction duration_ for each minute which
corresponds to single row. For this lab more metric definitions are as follows:

```
{
  "ONLINE_TRANSACTION_COUNT": {
    "defaultAggregate": "SUM",
    "defaultResolutionMS": 60000,
    "description": "Count of online transactions",
    "displayName": "Online Transaction Count",
    "displayNameShort": "Online Tran. #",
    "type": "Database",
    "unit": "number"
  },

  "ONLINE_TRANSACTION_TIME": {
    "defaultAggregate": "AVG",
    "defaultResolutionMS": 60000,
    "description": "Time of online transactions",
    "displayName": "Online Transaction Time",
    "displayNameShort": "Online Trans. Time",
    "type": "Database",
    "unit": "duration"
  }
}
```
